# Daily Java Topics for Top 10 Product Companies - Top 1% Developer Guide

## Core Java Fundamentals

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** - Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. These form the foundation of all Java applications and are used in every codebase.

**Collections Framework** - ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, LinkedList, TreeMap, and their implementations. Essential for data manipulation, caching, and efficient data structures in applications.

**Exception Handling** - Try-catch blocks, custom exceptions, and error management. Critical for building robust applications that handle failures gracefully.

## Spring Framework Ecosystem

**Spring Boot** - Auto-configuration, dependency injection, and rapid application development. The de facto standard for building enterprise Java applications with minimal setup.

**Spring MVC** - RESTful web services, controllers, and web application architecture. Used for building scalable web APIs and microservices.

**Spring Data JPA** - Database operations, repository patterns, and ORM mapping. Essential for data persistence and database interactions in modern applications.

## Concurrency and Performance

**Multithreading and Concurrency** - Thread management, synchronization, ExecutorService, and concurrent collections. Crucial for building high-performance applications that handle multiple users simultaneously.

## Database Integration

**JDBC and Database Connectivity** - Database connections, SQL operations, and data access layers. Fundamental for any application that stores and retrieves data.

## Build and Deployment

**Maven/Gradle** - Dependency management, build automation, and project structure. Essential for managing libraries, building applications, and deployment pipelines.

## Modern Development Practices

**Microservices Architecture** - Service-to-service communication, API design, and distributed systems. Increasingly important as companies move toward scalable, maintainable architectures.

These topics are used daily because they address the core challenges in enterprise software development: handling data efficiently, building scalable web services, managing complex business logic, ensuring application reliability, and maintaining code quality across large development teams.
